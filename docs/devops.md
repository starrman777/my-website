# DevOps and Cloud

This is my area of expertise.  I have (Nov 2022) approximately 12 years experience developing software applications and then another 12+ years experience automating the build, test and deployment of applications.  Over the past few years I have applied these skills in the Cloud (AWS).

Developers are great at developing software but they aren't always great about delivering that software into production in ways that minimize errors.  While there are thousands of ways to automate technical processes, it is a higher level of operation to automate these processes by creating reusable assets that others can easily understand and adopt and that greatly improve the quality, security and resiliency of the application.
