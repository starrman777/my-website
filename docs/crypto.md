# Crypto
I love the concept of a currency that is decentralized!  I could open a new Bitcoin address that I own without anyone's permission.  I can even keep this currency on a hardware wallet that no bank or government has access to.  While there are many hurdles for the average non-technical person and while the industry is still in it's wild-wild-west phase, I find the potential intriging enough to continue to press in and learn more.
