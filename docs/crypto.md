# Crypto
I am fascinated by the technologies as well as the financial and sociological implications of Cryptocurrencies.  In recent years, I have been seeing increasing attempts to control the behavior of others by governents or corporations.

I have become more interested in the potential of decentralized currencies that no government or company has the ability to control.  Control sounds wonderful if those in power agree with you and are in your camp but what if the controllers are not in your camp?  It doesn't sounds as much fun anymore and when you are responsible for providing for your family like I am, you begin to look for consider contingency plans!

I love the concept of a currency that is decentralized!  I could open a new Bitcoin address that I own without anyone's permission.  I can even keep this currency on a hardware wallet that no bank has access to.  While there are many hurdles for the average consumer and while the industry is still in it's wild-wild-west phase wrot with many perills, I find the potential intriging enough to continue to press in and learn more.
