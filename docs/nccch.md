##Great Things About My Classes:

- **Ideal for New Shooters**:  I love teaching shooters that have no experience.  The way that I teach is with patience, in a relaxing atmosphere (my home) and with great coffee :-)
  
- **Class**:  Most of the class is in the classroom.  After the classroon part we all head over to the shooting range for more instruction and for the shooting qualification part of the class.  Since the classroom part is in my home, it is a very comfortable atmosphere with a big screen TV, large couches and chairs and great coffee!
  
- **Shooting Range**: The shooting range is at an outdoor range.  There is a huge different between an indoor and an outdoor range.  I greatly prefer outdoor and DPRC is a great outdoor range.  https://dprc.org
  
- **Cost**: At the moment, the cost is $100.  This may increase soon. If you compare this price with others, you will see that this price is on the low side.
  
- **I offer private classes**:  Ideal class sizes are 10 or 12 students.
