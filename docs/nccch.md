# I am a North Carolina Concealed Carry Instructor

The Concealed Carry class offers North Carolina residents the opportunity to receive your NC Concealed Carry Handgun (CCH) permit.

Classes:
- Saturday, Nov 19, 2022: https://dprc.org/event-4993588
- 1st Qtr of 2023:  A private class for a group of Nurses (date TBD)

Great Things About My Classes:
- Ideal for New Shooters:  I love teaching shooters that have no experience.  The way that I teach is with patience, in a relaxing atmosphere (my home) and with great coffee :-)
- Classroom Part is in my home:  The class is around 8 hours so a comfortable couch or chair helps a lot.
- The Range Part is at an outdoor range.  There is a hugs different between an indoor and an outdoor range.  I greatly prefer outdoor and DPRC is a great outdoor range.  https://dprc.org
- I offer private classes.  Ideal class sizes are 10 or 12 students.
