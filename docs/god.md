# The God Page

Ha!  I have to laugh a little at the fear that some must feel when they click on this page.  They are afraid that someone is going to launch into some sort of religious diatribe.  I totally understand because I don't like it either when someone does that.  You can relax.  You are safe here!

The only thing I will say about this for now is that I believe in a God who loves everyone exactly as they are.  You do not have to change anything for him to love you.  His great desire is relationship; it is for everyone to be restored to a loving father/son or father/daughter relationship with him.  

You are His and He is yours!
