## Welcome to the website of Eric Starr

You can begin to learn a little more about me one these pages.  I am a technologist with a great love of family and friends and with a neverending thankfulness to the One who made it all possible.  Like many others, difficult times have visited our family.  You will not, however, find a victim in these pages.  What you will find, I hope, is one who loves and learns and continuously grows past his own limitations.
